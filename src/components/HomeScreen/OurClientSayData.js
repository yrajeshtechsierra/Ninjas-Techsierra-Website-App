I would tag things in for the TS team and the engineers were responsible for picking up their own tasks; I swear nothing sat in the queue for more than 3 working hours. The team leads were great at communicating when there were issues or if they needed more work in the queue. Over the year and a half we had together, the TS team closed out over 1,100 tickets, which is incredible! We would have drown without them on our team.`,
